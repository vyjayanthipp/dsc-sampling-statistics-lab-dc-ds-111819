    "# Sampling Statistics - Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, we don't know statistics about a population itself. The only way to know these for sure is to survey the entirety of the population, which is typically impractical. For example, to know the true salary mean of individuals in the United States, we would have to survey each and every individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "In lieu of being able to know the true underlying population statistics, we estimate them. Point estimates are estimates of population parameters based on sample data. For instance, if we wanted to know the average age of registered voters in the U.S., we could take a survey of registered voters and then use the average age of the respondents as a point estimate of the average age of the population as a whole. \n",
    "\n",
    "The average of a sample is known as the sample mean. Sampling distribution can be thought of as relative frequency distribution with a large number of samples. A relative frequency distribution tends to approach the sampling distribution as the number of samples increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Calculate and interpret sampling error\n",
    "* Explain how sample size is related to sampling error\n",
    "* Explain how the sampling error is related to population standard deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background and Terminologies \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to learn the **population mean**, we don't measure the whole population. Instead, we take a random sample and use **sample mean, ( x_bar or $\\bar{x}$ )** to estimate the population mean **( mu or $\\mu$ )**. The sample mean is usually not exactly the same as the population mean and depends upon the values of samples chosen, however, the population mean remains fixed. While using the **sample mean** to estimate the population mean, we come across the **sampling error**, which directly relates to the **standard deviation** of a sampling statistic (e.g. mean values). This difference can be caused by many factors including poor survey design, biased sampling methods, and the randomness inherent to drawing a sample from a population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's learn about these concepts through an example."
